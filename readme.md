There are still some cases where ie9 needs polyfills despite
nice SVG and a few other good things support, like datasets,
typed arrays, etc. Some effort here has gone into not
clobbering native implementations of things, I think it is all
Eli Grey and Joshua Bell. A few things here also cover
ie 10 ommissions.

Mostly placed here in a pinch needing github.io cnd type support.
If you a) want to do ie9 stuff like this comprehensively or
b) want to do something awesome with the name nueve, let me know.
